This project uses a pre-trained Legal BERT model to detect legal clauses in contracts. The model classifies contract clauses into predefined categories based on input text.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- Transformers
- Datasets
- PyTorch
- Pyngrok

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/legal-clause-detector.git
    cd legal-clause-detector
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Streamlit app:

    ```bash
    streamlit run legal_clause_detector_app.py
    ```

4. Access the app through the local URL (`http://localhost:8501`) or use ngrok to share it publicly.
